My name is Bhargav Kollati. I am from India.
I am currently learning Python, FastAPI, and backend development and I am very interested in software development.

I have worked on small projects like expense tracker application and database-related projects, which helped me understand how real applications work using Python and SQL.

My strengths are quick learning, problem solving, and self-motivation.
I always try to improve my skills by practicing and building projects.

My short-term goal is to get a job as a software developer, and my long-term goal is to become a good backend engineer.

That’s all about me. Thank you!
