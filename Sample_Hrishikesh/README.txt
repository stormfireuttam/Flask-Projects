My name is Hrishikesh Kaithoju, and I am from Jagtial. I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering from Anurag Group Of Institutions.
I have  11 months of experience as a Junior Software Engineer at AJA CS, where I gained hands-on experience in both frontend and backend development. On the frontend, I have worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and on the backend, I have experience with Python, Django, and Flask, along with MySQL for database management.
I have worked on projects like a Personal Finance Tracker and a HRMS, which helped me understand real-world application development and problem-solving.
I am a motivated, proactive, and adaptable person, always eager to learn new technologies and apply my skills to real-world challenges. I am looking forward to contributing to a growth-oriented organization while continuously improving my technical skills.
